# python-scripts

My ETL scripts

## Getting Started

```
# HOW TO RUN
# python3 transform.py clientname filename incremental
# set incremental to true, default is false
```

We highly recommend using a new virtual environment for each of the Python scripts.

```
python3 -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
